-- A lot of what happens in Septum is related to strings.  It reads them from
-- file, uses them as input for commands, looks for them with filters, attempts
-- to match them with regular expressions and prints them to users.
--
-- ## UTF-8 Compatibility
--
-- Any solution to handling all of these in a UTF-8 compatible manner, must
-- then deal appropriately with all of the interfaces with which these things
-- touch.  Due to the tight binding within Septum of all of these behaviors,
-- it may not be possible to extricate enough of string handling for a drop in
-- replacement, and a complete refactoring to properly handle UTF-8 in all
-- situations may be impossible.
--
-- The binding of strings to fixed sizes also remains painful, as it requires
-- the use of an additional unbounded type, and often semantically meaningless
-- and inefficient conversions between the two types.  In many situations,
-- fixed strings aren't possible, such as being stored in vectors, sets or used
-- as keys in maps.  This often results in doubling the size of the interface,
-- or clumsily converting as needed.
--
-- My approach thus far has been to write interfaces using `String` as much as
-- possible, falling back to unbounded strings only when absolutely necessary.
-- There is likely a considerable amount of time needed to convert due to this
-- approach.
--
-- What I probably should have done initially was to define a private string
-- type to use everywhere with easy conversions and use either string interning
-- or underlying unbounded strings.  The current form of `Unbounded_String` is
-- also somewhat unwieldly.
--
-- The [VSS](https://github.com/AdaCore/VSS) library looks like a viable
-- alternative to `Unbounded_String`, though it is marked with "Warning: This is
-- experimental work in progress, everything is subject to change. It may be or
-- may be not part of GNATCOLL or standard Ada library in the future."
--
-- Known systems which use strings:
-- - Terminal I/O (Trendy Terminal)
--   - Formatting
--   - Hinting system
--   - Autocomplete
-- - Search
--   - Regular expressions
-- - File I/O
-- - Command interpretation
