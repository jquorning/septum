-- Super simple text file caching.
--
-- While `Async_File_Cache` provides parallel loading, access to the cache
-- itself is protected.
--
-- Provides a means to load entire directory structures into memory and then
-- use it as needed. This is intended for text files only, in particular, to
-- speed text searches of large read-only code bases.
--
-- This is super simple and straightforward, but works well enough.
-- It probably better done with mmap to load files directly to memory.  It
-- eliminates line-splitting when printing output.  If this were in C++,
-- it would be possible to do something like store the file as a huge byte
-- block with mmap and then replace newlines with '\0' and store byte counts
-- to the initial part of every string.
